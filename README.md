- This is a quick testing branch which uses an alternate design pattern in which every seperate FXML doc has it's own controller, instead of using a pipeline functionality. To showcase how this works press the giant test button on the main menu page. This button adds a test item to the shopping cart and transfers you to the shopping cart page which is a seperate controller than the one in which the function is being called upon. The ShoppingCartController.java contains the updateShoppingCart function which performs the add to shopping cart functionality for proof of concept demonstration.
